# PointLinker

**PointLinker is a technical partner platform that builds and operates durable digital engines for small, independent businesses and creators — starting with artists.**

We don’t build disposable websites or lock clients into brittle platforms.
Instead, we design and run long-lived digital engines that power complete, client-owned ecosystems: content, commerce, integrations, and operations.

PointLinker sits between agencies and SaaS tools:

- more scalable than bespoke agency work
- more flexible and humane than rigid platforms

Each engine is:

- **isolated** per client
- **evolvable** over time
- **portable**, with no artificial lock-in
- operated as a partnership, not a product licence

### What we’re building

- A shared engine core, extended through **Flavours** (Artist, Service, Boutique, …)
- Artist-first ecosystems as the initial proving ground
- Infrastructure that grows with the work, not against it

### How we work

- Engine-first, not CMS-first
- Explicit architecture and constraints
- Long-term ownership over short-term convenience
- Building in public, deliberately and responsibly

### Repositories

- **pointlinker-engine** — the core engine that powers all PointLinker ecosystems
- **pointlinker-docs** — architecture, operations, and evolution strategy

---

PointLinker is an infrastructure for people who plan to be around.
